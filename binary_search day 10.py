#Binary search is a fast search algorithm with run-time complexity of ÎŸ(log n).
#This search algorithm works on the principle of divide and conquer.
#For this algorithm to work properly, the data collection should be in the sorted form.
#Binary search looks for a particular item by comparing the middle most item of the collection.
#If a match occurs, then the index of item is returned.
#If the middle item is greater than the item, then the item is searched in the sub-array to the left of the middle item.
#Otherwise, the item is searched for in the sub-array to the right of the middle item.
#This process continues on the sub-array as well until the size of the subarray reduces to zero.
