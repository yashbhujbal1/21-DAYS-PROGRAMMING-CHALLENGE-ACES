#Bucket sort is also known as bin sort.
#It works by distributing the element into the array also called buckets.
#Buckets are sorted individually by using different sorting algorithm.
#Bucket sort is mainly useful when input is uniformly distributed over a range.
#
#bucketSort(arr[], n)
#1) Create n empty buckets (Or lists).
#2) Do following for every array element arr[i].
#.......a) Insert arr[i] into bucket[n*array[i]]
#3) Sort individual buckets using insertion sort.
#4) Concatenate all sorted buckets.
